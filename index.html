            <pre>
    loreA man on a boat,  
    Drifting down the river,  
    With the sun on his face,  
    And the wind in his hair.
                
    The water flows gently,  
    As he glides through the current,  
    And the birds in the trees,  
    Sing a song of peace.
                
    He looks out to the shore,  
    And sees nothing but green,  
    A world of endless beauty,  
    Waiting to be explored.
                
    The boat rocks softly,  
    As he closes his eyes,  
    And drifts off into a dream,  
    Of adventure and discovery.</pre>
